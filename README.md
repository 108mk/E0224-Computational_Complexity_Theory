> $\bullet$ Universal Turing machine (UTM) and Church-Turing thesis

> UTM overhead of $\mathcal{O}(T\cdot log(T))$ [proof omitted]
> $\bullet$ Possible violation of Strong Church-Turing Thesis due to Quantum Machine

$\textbf{Part-II}:$
> $\bullet$ Deterministic Turing Machine and complexity class $P$
> $\bullet$ Non-deterministic Turing Machine and complexity class $NP$
